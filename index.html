                                            <h1>2012</h1>

                                            <div>
                                                <p>The 2012 season was a much more challenging season for Vettel and his team. In the first 8 races, Vettel
                                                   won <strong>1</strong> race, at the <strong>Bahrain Grand Prix</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>Prior to the Singapore Grand Prix (14th race of the season), Vettel was <strong>39 points</strong> behind championship leader, Fernando Alonso.
                                                    From Singapore onwards, he had <strong>4 straight victories</strong>, in Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and India. At this point, he had taken back
                                                    the championship lead.</p>

                                                <p>The last couple of races provided challenging conditions to Vettel. In the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Vettel started from the <strong>back of the grid</strong>, since in Qualifying, his car failed to meet fuel regulations.
                                                In spite of this, Vettel went from <strong>last to 3rd place</strong>! During the race, he collided with Bruno Senna and 
                                                on a separate occasion, he also collided with the DRS board, to avoid crashing into Daniel Ricciardo</p>

                                                <p>The season finale was in Brazil. Prior to the race, Vettel was <strong>13 points</strong> ahead of Fernando Alonso.
                                                The race proved to be extremely challenging for Vettel. At the start of the race, Vettel was <strong>spun round</strong>, following a collision with Bruno Senna. In spite of the collision, the rainy conditions, and radio problems, 
                                                Vettel brought his car home in 6th place, which <strong>won</strong> him
                                                the <strong>Championship</strong> by just <strong>3 points</strong>!</p>

                                                <p>In the 2012 season, Vettel achieved <strong>5</strong> wins, <strong>6</strong> poles, and <strong>10</strong> podiums.
                                                    Vettel had now become a <strong>3-time F1 World Champion</strong>!</p>

                                                <p>The 2013 F1 season was another one of Vettel's dominant seasons. In spite of a solid 1st half of the season, 
                                                    in which he achieved <strong>wins</strong> at the <strong>Malaysian, Bahrain, Canadian, and German</strong> Grand Prix. 
                                                    His dominance really started from the 2nd half of the season.</p>

                                                <p>From the Belgium Grand Prix to the end of the season (<strong>9 races in total</strong>), Vettel <strong>won the remaining

                                                <p>In the 2013 season, Vettel achieved <strong>13 wins</strong>, <strong>9 poles</strong>, and <strong>16 podiums</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>Vettel had now become a <strong>4-time F1 World Champion</strong>. He was also the <strong>youngest</strong> 4-time World Champion in F1 history. It was now clear that Vettel was among the greatest

                                                <p>2014 marked a new <strong>era</strong> in Formula 1. With a brand new set of technical regulations, there was a <strong>new dominant team</strong> in Formula 1: Mercedes.</p>

                                                <p>Red Bull were <strong>no longer the leading F1 team</strong>, and this reflected on Vettel's performances. 
                                                He was also partnered with a new and upcoming talent, Daniel Ricciardo.</p>

                                                <p>Vettel endured a difficult 2014 season. He found it challenging to adapt to this new set of rules and was plagued with reliability issues.
                                                   For the first time since 2007, Vettel had a winless season.</p>
                                                   
                                                <p>In the 2014 season, Vettel placed <strong>4th</strong> in the F1 World Championship and achived <strong>4 podiums</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>Near the end of the 2014 season, Vettel announced that from <strong>next season onwards</strong>, he would be driving for the 
                                                  <strong>renowned Scuderia Ferrari</strong>!</p>

                                                2014 proved to be a tough year for Ferrari. In 2014, Ferrari finished a <strong>lowly

                                                <p>At the Malaysian Grand Prix, Vettel <strong>won</strong> his <strong>1st</strong> race with <strong>Ferrari</strong>! This just
                                                came in his <strong>2nd race</strong> with Ferrari.</p>

                                                <p>Further wins came in Hungary and Singapore. In Singapore, he achieved his <strong>1st pole position</strong> with Ferrari 
                                                and <strong>dominated</strong> the race!</p>

                                                <p>Despite a resurgent season from both Vettel and Ferrari, the car's overall performance was quite behind Mercedes.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>In the 2015 season, Vettel placed <strong>3rd</strong> in the F1 World Championship. He achieved <strong>3 wins</strong>, <strong>1 pole</strong>, and <strong>13 podiums</strong>.
                                                    Ferrari placed <strong>2nd</strong> in the Constructors Championship, a notable improvement from 2014.</p>

                                                    The car's overall performance was quite <strong>behind Mercedes</strong> and at times, even <strong>behind Red Bull</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>At the <strong>season opener</strong> in Melbourne, Vettel made a <strong>blistering start</strong>, jumping both Mercedes cars and lead the race. However, an <strong>odd strategy</strong> 
                                                    from <strong>Ferrari</strong> and a <strong>slow pitstop</strong> ultimately caused Vettel to finish <strong>3rd</strong> in the race.</p>
                                                    
                                                <p>In Canada, just like Melbourne, Vettel made a <strong>superb start</strong>, jumping both Mercedes cars and lead the race. However, just like Melbourne, Ferrari made the 
                                                    <strong>wrong strategy</strong> call, causing Vettel to finish <strong>2nd</strong> in the race. He himself also <strong>locked up</strong> a couple of times at the Wall of Champions corner.</p>

                                                <p>Overall, the 2016 season proved to be dissapointing for Vettel and Ferrari. Vettel endured another winless season. 
                                                In the 2016 season, Vettel placed <strong>4th</strong> in the Championship and earned <strong>7 podiums</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>2017 marked another change in the technical regulations. It helped Ferrari <strong>close up</strong> the <strong>performance gap</strong> to Mercedes.
                                                For half of the season, the car's <strong>performance</strong> was <strong>on par</strong> with Mercedes.</p>

                                                <p>Vettel started the season very well, <strong>winning 2</strong> out of the <strong>first 3 grand prix</strong>.
                                                At the Russian Grand Prix, Vettel earned his <strong>2nd pole</strong> with the team. He also went on to <strong>win</strong> 
                                                the <strong>Monaco</strong> and <strong>Hungarian</strong> Grand Prix. At the <strong>halfway</strong> point of the <strong>season</strong>, 
                                                Vettel was <strong>leading</strong> the Championship and amassed <strong>4 wins</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>However, in the <strong>2nd half</strong> of the season, Ferrari <strong>lacked overall car performance</strong> compared to Mercedes, and
                                                Vettel faced <strong>reliability issues</strong>.
                                                In the Singapore Grand Prix, despite Vettel's <strong>stunning pole position</strong>, he retired from the race, due to an <strong>early collision</strong> 
                                                with teammate, Kimi Raikkonen and Max Verstappen.Vettel faced <strong>reliability issues</strong> in the Malaysian Grand Prix's Qualifying session, forcing him to start the race from <strong>last</strong>. 
                                                In the Japanese Grand Prix, Vettel faced <strong>reliability problems</strong> right from the start of the race, forcing him
                                                into another retirement.</p>

                                                <p>Despite a <strong>pole</strong> at the <strong>Mexican Grand Prix</strong> and <strong>victory</strong> at the <strong>
                                                Brazilian Grand Prix</strong>, Vettel fell short in his 2017 title quest. In spite of this, Vettel finished <strong>2nd</strong> in the 
                                                World Championship and achieved <strong>5 wins</strong>,

                                            <h1>2018</h1>

                                            <div>

                                                <p>2018 was a season that consisted of <strong>costly</strong> mistakes from Vettel's side and <strong>Ferrari</strong> 
                                                    not being <strong>operationally strong</strong>, especially on circuits in which it had the quicker car.</p>

                                                <p>Vettel had the perfect start to the season, winning the <strong>first 2 Grand Prix</strong> in Australia and Bahrain.
                                                Vettel had a run of <strong>3 pole positions in a row</strong>, in Bahrain, China, and Baku. However, in China, Verstappen collided with Vettel, causing Vettel to finish in 8th. 
                                                In Baku, it was looking like a comfortable win for Vettel. However, a late safety car put him in 2nd place, behind Bottas. 
                                                When Vettel tried an <strong>audacious move</strong> on Valterri Bottas, Vettel locked up, causing him to finish in 4th. </p>

                                                <p>Vettel achieved <strong>another pole position and victory</strong> at the Canadian Grand Prix. He added another <strong>victory</strong> 
                                                to the season, winning at the <strong>British Grand Prix</strong>. At this point,
                                                Vettel was having a very strong season.</p>

                                                <p>However, a major <strong>turning point</strong> came at his home race, <strong>the German Grand Prix</strong>. Despite Vettel's <strong>dominant pole position</strong>, 
                                                    the Grand Prix proved to be less straightforward. Vettel was <strong>leading</strong> for much of the race. However, <strong>rainy conditions</strong> 
                                                    caused Vettel to crash out and retire from the race. His title rival, Lewis Hamilton, started the race from 14th position, and won the race.
                                                    Vettel bounced back from this setback, going on to <strong>dominate and win</strong> the <strong>Belgian Grand Prix</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>However, from this race onwards, <strong>Ferrari's operational errors</strong> and <strong>lack of car performance</strong>
                                                and Vettel's <strong>driving mistakes</strong> ultimately ended his title hopes. At the <strong>Italian Grand Prix</strong>, Vettel spun round, 
                                                after a <strong>collision</strong> with Hamilton. In Singapore, Russia, and Japan, Ferrari lacked overall <strong>car performance</strong> to Mercedes. 
                                                In Japan, Vettel had a poor qualifying, due to <strong>Ferrari</strong> putting Vettel on the <strong>wrong tires at the wrong time</strong>. Starting from 9th place, 
                                                Vettel tried an <strong>audacious</strong> overtake on Verstappen, causing Vettel to spin around.
                                                In the US Grand Prix, Vettel spun around again, after <strong>colliding</strong> with Ricciardo.</p>

                                                <p>Overall, Vettel finished <strong>2nd</strong> in the World Championship, again behind Lewis Hamilton. In this season, Vettel achieved <strong>5 wins</strong>, <strong>5 poles</strong>, 
                                                   and <strong>12 podiums</strong>.</p>

                                            <div>
                                                <p>2019 was another up and down season for Vettel. In 2019, Vettel was partnered alongside the prodigious, upcoming talent, Charles Leclerc. For the first half of the season, Ferrari were 
                                                    <strong>2nd-best in car performance</strong>, except at power-heavy circuits. In addition to the performance deficit, Vettel made <strong>minor</strong> errors and <strong>Ferrari</strong> 
                                                    made <strong>operational errors</strong>.</p>

                                                <p>Vettel's <strong>1st pole</strong> of the season came in <strong>Canada</strong>. During the race, Vettel was keeping a marginal lead over Hamilton. 
                                                    Vettel made a mistake and <strong>locked up</strong>. Despite this, he kept his lead over Hamilton. 
                                                    However, he was <strong>penalized</strong> for unsafely rejoining the track. Vettel finished first in the race, but was demoted to 2nd, due to his penalty.</p>

                                                <p>Vettel was plagued with <strong>reliability issues</strong> in the qualifying sessions for the Austrian and German Grand Prix. 
                                                    In Austria, Vettel made a good <strong>comeback</strong>, finishing in 4th. In Germany, despite starting <strong>last</strong>, 
                                                    he made a <strong>superb comeback</strong>, coming home in <strong>2nd position</strong>.
                                                </p>

                                                 <p>In the <strong>2nd half</strong> of the season, Ferrari were much more competitive, but Vettel again made <strong>minor</strong> errors and faced <strong>reliabity issues</strong>. 
                                                    In Italy, Vettel made a mistake, causing him to spin around. 
                                                    In Singapore, Vettel pulled off a <strong>stunning undercut</strong> and went on to <strong>win his 1st race</strong> of the year.
                                                    In Japan, Vettel achieved a <strong>dominant pole</strong>. However, he had a poor start in the race, causing him to finish the race in 2nd position. 
                                                    In the Russian Grand Prix, Vettel made a <strong>fantastic start</strong>, helping him lead the race. However, he retired from the race
                                                    due to <strong>reliability problems</strong>. In the USA Grand Prix, Vettel encountered a <strong>suspension failure</strong>, causing him to retire from the race.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Vettel finished <strong>5th</strong> in the World Championship. In this season, he achieved <strong>1 win</strong>, <strong>2 poles</strong>, and <strong>9 podiums</strong>.</p>

                                            <div>
                                                <p>2020 was a difficult season for Vettel and Ferrari. The car's <strong>performance</strong> was perdominantly among <strong>midfield-level cars.</strong>
                                                Prior to the start of the season, it was also announced that this would be Vettel's <strong>last year with Ferrari</strong>. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Although Vettel achieved <strong>6th place and 7th place finishes</strong> at Hungary and Spain, the car was just not good enough. 
                                                   His <strong>brightest moment</strong> of the season came in Turkey, in which he finished in <strong>3rd place</strong>.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Vettel finished <strong>13th</strong> in the Championship. In the season, he only achieved <strong>1 podium</strong>. 
                                                    <strong>Ferrari</strong> finished <strong>6th</strong> in the Constructors Championship, which was their 
                                                    <strong>lowest finishing position</strong> in recent years.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Although Vettel didn't win the World Championship at Ferrari, he had a great time at Ferrari. 
                                                    In his <strong>6 seasons</strong> with Ferrari, he achieved <strong>14 wins</strong>, <strong>12 poles</strong>, and <strong>55 podiums</strong>. 
                                                    He finished <strong>2nd</strong> in the Championship <strong>twice</strong>!</p>

                                                <p>Vettel's next chapter in F1 was with the <strong>newly branded Aston Martin F1 Team</strong>!</p>

                                            <p>2021 was Vettel's <strong>1st year</strong> with Aston Martin. For Vettel, the season was a <strong>new form</strong> of life in F1, 
                                            since the car was <strong>operating</strong> in the midfield.</p>
                                            <p>Despite a slow start to the season, at the Baku Grand Prix, Vettel had <strong>strong</strong> race pace and he took advantage 
                                               of the chaos throughout the race. As a result, He finished the race in <strong>2nd place</strong>! It was his <strong>1st podium</strong> with <strong>Aston Martin</strong>
                                               and it was the <strong>team's 1st ever podium</strong>.</p>
                                               
                                            <p>At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Vettel finished the race in <strong>2nd place</strong>. However, he was <strong>later disqualified</strong> since his car did not meet fuel regulations.</p>

                                            <p>Overall, considering the <strong>team's</strong> lack of pace</strong>, Vettel had a <strong>solid debut season</strong> with Aston Martin. 
                                            Vettel finished <strong>12th</strong> in the Championship. The team finished <strong>7th</strong> in the Constructors

                                               the season</strong> was at <strong>Baku</strong>, in which he finished in <strong>6th position</strong>.</p>
                                            <p>Prior to the Hungarian Grand Prix, Vettel announced that he will be <strong>retiring from F1</strong> at the <strong>end of the season</strong>. 
                                               Determined to end the season on a high, he achieved more <strong>points finishes</strong> at Hungary, Belgium, Singapore, Japan, and the United States Grand Prix.</p>
                                            <p>At the <strong>final Grand Prix</strong> of his <strong>F1 career</strong>, Vettel qualified in 9th position and finished in 10th.</p>
                                            <p>Although he finished <strong>12th</strong> again in the Championship and his <strong>team</strong> finished <strong>7th</strong> 
                                            again in the Constructors Championship, this marked the <strong>end</strong> of his time with <strong>Aston Martin</strong>
                                            and also a <strong>glittering Formula 1 career</strong>!</p>
